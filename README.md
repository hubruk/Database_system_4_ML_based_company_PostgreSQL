# Database_system_4_ML_based_company
## Project

### Case Study:
Database system running in a company engaged in diagnosing rare diseases using machine learning algorithms. 
It is expected to accept medical data, for post-processing, by data engineers or machine learning specialists. 
It will be possible to view the contents of the database (without interfering with them), also by specialized doctors. 
The data can be entered directly by individual patients (they also have insight into their own data), but mainly by data engineers, with larger portions supplied from various sources, such as hospitals cooperating with the company.
